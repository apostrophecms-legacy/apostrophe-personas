# Changelog

## 2.1.0

* Basic support for setting personas for pieces. So far we are not preventing them from being returned in index views of pieces or widgets for other personas, we are just making the information available and switching persona if you visit the "show" page of one.
* Helpfully infer a persona URL prefix if none is configured for a particular locale, but display a warning that it is not localized at startup.
* Do not crash on a bad persona in a session or query string.

## 2.0.2

npm packaging issues. No code changes.

## 2.0.1

License explicitly copied in. No code changes.

## 2.0.0

First npm published release, with good test coverage.
